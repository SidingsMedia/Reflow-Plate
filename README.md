# Reflow Plate

This repo contains the schematics, board designs and firmware for
Sidings Media's version of the PCB based SMD reflow plate. The reflow
plate provides a convenient way to easily reflow PCBs cheaply. Thanks to
[AfterEarthLTD](https://github.com/AfterEarthLTD/Solder-Reflow-Plate)
for the original inspiration. This version aims to provide greater
modulatity to the system allowing for a range of different board sizes
and micro controller boards to be used.
